SplashKit works with a number of programming languages.
Each of these has its own set of tools you will need to install.

* For C#, install the [.NET Core](/articles/installation/mac/languages/dotnet) SDK.
* For C++, you're _already_ ready to go.

Guides for other supported languages like Python and Pascal are coming soon.

## What's next?

Congratulations! If you've followed these steps correctly, then you will have
installed all the tools needed to start programming with SplashKit!

It's time to get programming...
