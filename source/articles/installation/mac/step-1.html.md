The Command Line Tools provided by Xcode provide a large amount of developer
tools required to compile and develop applications.

To do this, open up the _Terminal_ application by:

1. opening _Finder_ (the first app in the Dock),
1. clicking _Applications_ in the sidebar,
1. opening the _Utilities_ folder,
1. double-clicking the _Terminal_ app.

If you cannot find _Applications_ in your sidebar or can't find _Utilities_,
you can also jump straight to the _Utilities_ folder by opening Finder and
using the <kbd>⌘+Shift+U</kbd> shortcut.

Now type into the Terminal the following command, and hit return on your keyboard
to execute it.

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
